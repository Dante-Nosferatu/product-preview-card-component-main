## My process
In this project I alternated between "section" and "div" with the addition of the "button" tag along with 2 images

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

What I learned here was to alternate between the two images that the project gives me, thanks to a relative who has been in this world of web page creation for some time now.


### Continued development
I want to focus on knowing how to use flexbox, it's very useful
